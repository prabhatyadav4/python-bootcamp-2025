"""
This script demonstrates the use of Python virtual environments and package management. 
It includes the following concepts:

1. **Creating a Virtual Environment**:
    - Use the command `python -m venv <env_name>` to create a new virtual environment.
    - Example: `python -m venv myenv`.

2. **Activating the Virtual Environment**:
    - On Windows: `.\<env_name>\Scripts\activate`
    - On macOS/Linux: `source <env_name>/bin/activate`

3. **Installing Libraries**:
    - Once the environment is activated, use `pip install <library_name>` to install required libraries.
    - Example: `pip install requests`.

4. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**:
    - Use the command `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment.

5. **Additional Notes**:
    - To list installed packages: `pip list`.
    - To uninstall a package: `pip uninstall <library_name>`.
    - To freeze dependencies into a requirements file: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
    - To install dependencies from a requirements file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

This script may include functions or commands that utilize the above concepts to manage Python environments effectively.
